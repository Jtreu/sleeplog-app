            <h2>A web application for neurologists &amp; patients</h2>

          <h3><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is currently a work in progress. It is not yet meant for professional use in the medical field</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>This application is based off UCLA's 2 week sleep log form which can be found <a href="http://yoursleep.aasmnet.org/pdf/sleepdiary.pdf">here</a>
             I designed it to bring convenience to patients and neurologists both. A patient can easily login and log their sleep habits without worrying
             about losing their progres if they were to lose their form, and it's even better for neurologists. Neuroligists now have a comprehensive
             database they can access where they can easily find any of their patients and look at their sleep habits without having to sift through
             loads of paperwork. Be you patient, neuroligist, or just a digital tourist, I hope you enjoy what I've made!</p>
