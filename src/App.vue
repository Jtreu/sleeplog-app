    Use the sl-entry-dialog component.

    :open means we are passing data to the property (aka prop) called 'open' that's defined in this component.

    Since dialogIsOpen is just some data.. we can pass it. Vuejs handles all the propogation stuff when dialogIsOpen
    changes. So for instance, when dialogIsOpen changes to true or false, it will be updated in the sl-entry-dialog component.

    'entry' is yet another prop. If you look in the EntryDialog.vue component you'll see that it is expected to be of type Object.
    Again. Objects in javascript are just key:value pairs.

    For example:

    {
      'isCool': true,
      'isOpen': true,
      'initWorld': function () { console.log('Hello World') },
      'anotherObject': {
        'anotherKey': 'anotherValue',
        'anArray': [
          'stuff',
          'stuff2',
          'stuff3',
          5,
          6
          ]
      }
    }

    keys must be strings. However, values can be whatever.

    v-on:add allows us to listen to events that the component will propogate up to the parent (this is the parent component).
    In this case, we are listening to the 'add' event. In the component, when this.$emit('add') occurs, then we can know about it by using
    v-on:add="doSomething()".

    v-on:remove is a way for us to handle when the child component emits an even called 'remove'. Keep in mind these names are arbitrary. You
    could call it 'poop' or whatever. So if you wanted to listen to the event 'poop' you would do

    v-on:poop="" // in the string you call a function you want to do something in response to the poop. For example

    v-on:poop="console.log('mmmm mmm stuff')"

    You also notice the $event that we pass. If the child component passes an argument with their event emission:

    this.$emit('stuff', someArgument, someArgument2)

    Then we can use $event to get those arguments. In this case we are getting the index that is passed up and calling
    the removeActivity() function that we've defined in our methods object.

    v-on:close allows us to handle the emission of an event called 'close'
